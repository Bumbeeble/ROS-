~/.bashrc
~/bashrc:为每一个运行bash shell的用户执行此文件.当bash shell被打开时,该文件被读取。
每当一个命令行窗口（bash shell）被打开，~/.bashrc中的内容就会被运行。

.bashrc is a shell script that Bash runs whenever it is started interactively. You can put any command in that file that you could type at the command prompt.
You put commands here to set up the shell for use in your particular environment, or to customize things to your preferences. A common thing to put in .bashrc are aliases that you want to always be available.
.bashrc runs on every interactive shell launch.
